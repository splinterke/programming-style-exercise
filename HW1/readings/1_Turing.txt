Turing write this article to discuss if computers can be used to fill the gap of our knowledge and uncover the light of truth.

First he conceive a machine that can write symbols on a tape and can operation on the tape based on finite rules.\
It can move Left, Right, and it can Erase and Print. Turing illustrate that the information on the tape is capable\
of representing computable numbers and make calculations.

When this machine comes to solve a problem, it will finally either stop and give the answer, or run forever if the answer did not exist.\
Turing proved that computable sequences are not enumerable with diagonal process.

Then he discussed if the Entscheidungsproblem can be solved. Turing mathematically proved that you can never know if the machine will stop,\
so decidability can not be reached, and hence Entscheidungsproblem can not be solved.

I believe this is the most difficult paper I ever read, however the idea is straightforward.\
We can not investigate the true truth, because the process of our investigation is not calculated.\
This is similar to Relativity and Uncertainty Principle in physics.
