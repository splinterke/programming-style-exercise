Simula introduced objects, classes, inheritance and subclasses, virtual methods, \
coroutines, and discrete event simulation, and features garbage collection. \
Simula is considered the first object-oriented programming language. \
It is said that Simula contains facilities that up to now have not been fully \
utilized and not even understood by not only general programming public but also people from OOP community.

As its name implies, Simula was designed for doing simulations, and the needs of that domain \
provided the framework for many of the features of object-oriented languages today. \
In the late 1960s, the Norwegian developers of Simula, O. J. Dahl and Kristen Nygaard, \
were looking for a way for programs to simulate or model the world as computer users see it. \
They conceived the idea that programmers should model programs around object s rather than procedures. \
They also invented the idea of classes so that objects could be developed that shared similar characteristics. \
So that objects could communicate and make requests of each other, they conceived the simple notion of the message.
