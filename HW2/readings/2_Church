This article, same as the Turing article, gives a negative answer to the Entscheidungsproblem. \
This is done by Alonzo Church with the concept of "effective calculability" based on his lambda calculus.

Lambda calculus is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation \
based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution. \
It describes the sequence of performing functional computation. \
Church define the notion of an effectively calculable function of positive integers \
by identifying it with the notion of a recursive function of positive integers.

Background: In mathematics and computer science, a formal language \
is a set of strings of symbols that may be constrained by rules that are specific to it. \
A well-formed formula, often simply formula, is a word (i.e. a finite sequence of symbols from a given alphabet) \
that is part of a formal language. And a Gödel numbering is a function that assigns to each symbol \
and well-formed formula of some formal language a unique natural number, called its Gödel number.
